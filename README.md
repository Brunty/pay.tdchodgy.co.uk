# PayPal, Monzo and Starling payment gateway

Sounds more fancy than it is...

* Take a value from the URL.
* Ask if the payment should go to [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/), [Monzo](https://monzo.me/) or [Starling](https://settleup.starlingbank.com).
* Go to chosen provider with the value intact.
* Due to limits with Monzo & Starling payments over Â£100 will go straight to PayPal
